## Not Today!

This add-on replaces any reference to
log.bezut.info/instantbird/(today|yesterday) with the one that contains the real
date.

I'm NOT certain that this add-on works nicely with different timezones! I'm more
convinced that it doesn't but I've not tried yet. (I'm lucky to be only one or
two hours off from UTC :P)
